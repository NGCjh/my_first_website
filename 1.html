        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula" target="_blank" title="Stellar Nebula Wikipedia">The stellar nebula</a> is the <strong>birthplace of <u>stars</u></strong>. A nebula is a cloud of gas (hydrogen) and dust in space. Stars are born in this region under very high amounts of density and condenses into a huge globule of gas and dust and contracts under its own gravity.</p>

        <p>A nebula is a distinct luminescent part of interstellar medium, which can consist of ionized, neutral or molecular hydrogen and also cosmic dust. Nebulae are often star-forming regions, such as in the "Pillars of Creation" in the Eagle Nebula. In these regions, the formations of gas, dust, and other materials "clump" together to form denser regions, which attract further matter, and eventually will become dense enough to form stars. The remaining material is then thought to form planets and other planetary system objects.</p>
