        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula" target="_blank" title="Planetary nebula Wikipedia">Planetary Nebula</a>occur in the <strong><u>last stages</u> of a dying star.</strong> Though our own star, the sun, may not die for another 5 billion years about 10,000 of these nebula's are estimated to exist in the Milky Way. A Planetary Nebula by definition is, “ A large cloud of gas and dust in outer space ejected by an aging star near the end of its life cycle” (Science Tech-book). The term “planetary nebula” was created by William Herschel, who also discovered the planet Uranus. After the planetary nebula has taken place, a white dwarf will remain as the last stage of the death of an average star.</p>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf" target="_blank" title="White Dwarf Wikipedia">A white dwarf</a>by definition is “a relatively small, dense star at the end of its cycle, which generates little or no energy and has contracted to its dense state. These dead stars are full of energy, and stay that way, <strong><u>after the death of an average star.</u></strong></p>
